# General notes

- The kata is both suited for having two people solve it in front of an audience and for having pairs solve the kata at the same time. 
	- If you pick the navigator approach, give the first team at least 20 minutes to get used to the problem and the IDE. The next teams should work for 10 minutes.
	- If you pick the team approach, you should not participate but keep an eye on all teams and engage in their discussion.
- Keep an eye on feature creep, e.g. most people try to implement singular as soon as they spot the issue
- Keep the coder focused on the specific implementation task; some coders might try to implement multiple things at once despite the given task

# Notes for part 1

- Re. 1.1: Suggest to implement more than one test (e.g. 32 seconds as well)
- Re. 1.1: If they are fast, suggest a test for 0 seconds

- Re. 1.2: If you want to build a scenario where one has to break the API at this early stage, you could suggest a test for 2 hours that yields "120 minutes"

- Re. 1.3: Keep the coders from impementing more than one unit at once. Let them implement hours, then refactor towards an abstract unit implementation, then implement the next units

# Notes for part 2

- Re. 2.1: This task leaves room for interpretation: Either show the largest non-zero units, or just show the largest units, discarding those that are zero. You can argue, that by user experience measures, the user does not care about seconds when the span is as large as days or even months.
- Re. 2.1: Remind them to keep the API stable, eg. overload the function so brevity is supported
