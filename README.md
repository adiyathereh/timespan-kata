# Timespan Coding Kata

## Summary

The goal is to implement a utility function that 'pretty-prints' timespans. For example, 3620 seconds become "1 hour, 20 seconds ago". Such a function greatly enhances UX by providing the user a readable timespan without bothering it with details.

### Suggestions

- Use a unit testing library
- Use git and work in baby-steps
- Commit often
- Don't read or work ahead!

## Increments

### Part 1 - Simple pretty-printing

1. [Task 1.1](tasks/1.1.md)
2. [Task 1.2](tasks/1.2.md)
3. [Task 1.3](tasks/1.3.md)

### Part 2 - For brevity!

1. [Task 2.1](tasks/2.1.md)
2. [Task 2.2](tasks/2.2.md)
3. [Task 2.3](tasks/2.3.md)

### Part 3 - Lossy algorithm

1. [Task 3.1](tasks/3.1.md)
2. [Task 3.2](tasks/3.2.md)
3. [Task 3.3](tasks/3.3.md)
